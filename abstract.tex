\chapter*{Abstract}
I spent a fair bit of time procrastinating perfecting the template used for my
thesis. I've pulled out all the unnecessary bits and put it up on GitHub.
Hopefully some other poor PhD student will find it useful.

This template is particularly suited to students at the University of South
Australia. It meets the guidelines specified by the Graduate Research Office.
That said, with some adjustments this template should be useful for anybody.

This thesis template features a nice cover page, author's publications,
acknowledgements, TOC, List of Figures, Abbreviations, etc. and a handy thesis
quote.

To use this thesis, simply:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Fork and clone the GitHub repository
    \item Edit the information in thesis.tex
    \item Update images/00/author\_sig.png with your own signature
    \item Update images/00/uni.png1 with your university's logo
    \item Add your publications as citations in 00-publications.tex
    \item Tweak the styles as necessary
    \item Write your damn thesis!
\end{enumerate}

I'm happy to accept Pull Requests for improvements on this template.

Happy Writing!
